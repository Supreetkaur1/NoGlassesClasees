# 🌞 NoGlassesClasses - A SunSmart Scheduler  

Optimizing outdoor and indoor school activities using local sunlight data to promote **student health, vision, and productivity**.  

---

## 📌 Problem Statement  

Excessive sun exposure during school hours can increase the risk of UV-related health issues (e.g., sunburn, heat stress).  
At the same time, **insufficient outdoor activity contributes to rising cases of childhood myopia (nearsightedness)** and negatively impacts physical and mental wellbeing.  

Schools need a balanced schedule that:  
- Maximizes safe outdoor learning opportunities  
- Prevents overexposure to peak sun hours  
- Supports eye health and reduces the risk of myopia progression  

---

## 💡 Our Solution  

The **SunSmart Scheduler** dynamically generates a monthly class timetable for grades 1–5:  

- Uses **astronomical sunrise/sunset data** for a given location  
- Ensures **2 outdoor classes per day**, avoiding peak UV hours  
- Distributes indoor classes fairly across remaining time slots  
- Exports schedules in **CSV format** for easy sharing with teachers & parents

## 🎯 Motivation
  - Rising Childhood Myopia:
      description: >
        Studies suggest that limited outdoor exposure is a major factor in the global increase 
        of myopia among children. Outdoor light stimulates healthy eye growth and can slow 
        down myopia progression.

  - Health & Safety Balance:
      description: >
        Schools often struggle to balance outdoor learning with UV safety. While outdoor 
        time is essential, unplanned exposure during peak UV hours raises health risks.

  - Tech for Social Good:
      description: >
        Our motivation is to empower schools with data-driven schedules that not only promote 
        eye health but also ensure overall student wellbeing through optimized learning environments.
